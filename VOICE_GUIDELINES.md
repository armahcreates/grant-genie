# Voice & Copy Guidelines

## Overview
Grant Genie uses a professional yet approachable voice that empowers mission-driven leaders. Our copy should be clear, actionable, and free of jargon.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. **Be Clear and Direct**
- Use simple, everyday language
- Avoid corporate jargon or buzzwords
- Get to the point quickly

**Good:** "Start writing your grant proposal"  
**Bad:** "Leverage our AI-powered grant writing solution"

### 2. **Be Action-Oriented**
- Use strong verbs that describe what the user will do
- Make CTAs specific and outcome-focused
- Avoid vague language like "View," "See," or "Check"

**Good:** "View Grant Details," "Upload Compliance Document"  
**Bad:** "View," "Click Here," "Learn More"

### 3. **Be Empowering**
- Focus on what the user can accomplish
- Use "you" and "your" to personalize
- Celebrate progress and achievements

**Good:** "Your Headspace Command Center"  
**Bad:** "Dashboard Overview"
