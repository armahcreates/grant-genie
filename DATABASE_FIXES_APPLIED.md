# Database Fixes Applied

## âœ… Completed Fixes

### 1. âœ… Added Database Transactions
**File:** `db/index.ts`
- Added `withTransaction` helper function
- Configured Neon connection caching

**Updated Routes:**
- âœ… `app/api/grants/route.ts` - Grant creation now uses transaction
- âœ… `app/api/compliance/route.ts` - Compliance creation/update now uses transactions
- âœ… `app/api/grants/[id]/route.ts` - Grant update/delete now uses transactions
- âœ… `app/api/user/delete-account/route.ts` - User deletion now uses transaction
- âœ… `app/api/donor-sessions/route.ts` - Session creation now uses transaction

**Impact:** All multi-step database operations are now atomic

---

### 2. âœ… Optimized Dashboard Stats Query
**File:** `app/api/dashboard/stats/route.ts`
- Reduced from 5 separate queries to 1 optimized query
- Uses CTEs (Common Table Expressions) for better performance
- Single database round-trip instead of 5

**Before:**
```typescript
// 5 separate queries
const activeGrantsResult = await db.select({ count: count() })...
const totalFundingResult = await db.select({ total: sql`...` })...
const totalComplianceResult = await db.select({ count: count() })...
const completedComplianceResult = await db.select({ count: count() })...
const upcomingDeadlinesResult = await db.select({ count: count() })...
```

**After:**
```typescript
// Single optimized query with CTEs
const statsResult = await db.execute(sql`
  WITH grant_stats AS (...),
       compliance_stats AS (...)
  SELECT * FROM grant_stats, compliance_stats
`)
```

**Impact:** ~80% reduction in database queries, faster response times

---

### 3. âœ… Added Connection Pooling Configuration
**File:** `db/index.ts`
- Configured Neon connection caching (`neonConfig.fetchConnectionCache = true`)
- Added fetch options for better connection management
- Connection pooling handled automatically by Neon HTTP driver

**Impact:** Better connection reuse, reduced connection overhead

---

### 4. âœ… Fixed User Profile Query
**File:** `app/api/user/profile/route.ts`
- Removed unnecessary duplicate query
- Optimized name fetching logic

**Impact:** Reduced redundant database calls

---

### 5. âœ… Created Cascade Delete Migration
**File:** `db/migrations/0004_add_cascade_deletes.sql`
- Added ON DELETE CASCADE to foreign keys
- Ensures referential integrity at database level
- Automatic cleanup of related records

**Tables Updated:**
- `compliance_items` â†’ cascade when grant deleted
- `grant_budgets` â†’ cascade when grant deleted
- `budget_items` â†’ cascade when budget deleted
- `grant_milestones` â†’ cascade when grant deleted
- `grant_reports` â†’ cascade when grant deleted
- `grant_bookmarks` â†’ cascade when grant opportunity deleted
- `donor_interactions` â†’ cascade when donor deleted
- `organization_profiles` â†’ cascade when user deleted
- `user_preferences` â†’ cascade when user deleted

**Impact:** Data integrity enforced at database level, automatic cleanup

---

## ðŸ“‹ Summary

**Critical Issues Fixed:**
1. âœ… Transactions for all multi-step operations
2. âœ… Connection pooling configuration
3. âœ… Optimized dashboard query (5 queries â†’ 1)
4. âœ… Cascade delete behaviors
5. âœ… Fixed redundant queries

**Performance Improvements:**
- Dashboard stats: ~80% fewer queries
- All create/update operations: Atomic (all-or-nothing)
- Connection reuse: Better pooling

**Data Integrity:**
- Cascade deletes ensure no orphaned records
- Transactions ensure consistency
- Foreign key constraints enforced

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps (Optional)

1. **Add Database-Level Enums** (Low Priority)
   - Convert status fields from `text` to PostgreSQL enums
   - Better data integrity

2. **Add Query Result Validation** (Medium Priority)
   - Validate query results before use
   - Better error handling

3. **Add Repository Pattern** (Low Priority)
   - Abstract database access
   - Easier testing

4. **Add Query Monitoring** (Medium Priority)
   - Track slow queries
   - Performance metrics

## âœ… Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test grant creation (transaction rollback on error)
- [ ] Test compliance creation/update (transaction rollback)
- [ ] Test user deletion (transaction rollback)
- [ ] Test dashboard stats (single query)
- [ ] Test cascade deletes (delete grant, verify related records deleted)
- [ ] Test connection pooling (multiple concurrent requests)
